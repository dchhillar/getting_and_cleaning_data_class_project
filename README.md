Repo for the submission of the course project for the Johns Hopkins Getting and Cleaning Data Class via Coursear.

#Overview

This assignment is to demonstrate my ability to get and clean data by creating a tidy dataset that can be used for analysis.

#Data Details
The data linked to from the course website represents data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. 
A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

#Class Project Details
You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

 1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
 2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
 5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

#Review Criteria
 1. The submitted data set is tidy.
 2. The Github repo contains the required scripts.
 3. GitHub contains a code book that modifies and updates the available codebooks with the data to indicate all the variables and summaries calculated, along with units, and any other relevant information.
 4. The README that explains the analysis files is clear and understandable.
 5. The work submitted for this project is the work of the student who submitted it.

You can find more info about the variables, data, and transformations in the CodeBook.MD file.
